## What are we building?
At AuraX, we are transforming the 2D media of E-commerce sellers into interactive 3D Assets. We do this by capturing a video of the product of the seller and processing it via a NeRF / Photogrammetry pipeline. This converts the 2D videos/photos of the seller into 3D models which can be integrated on the seller's website 
via a single line of code or an embeddable link. Since the models are hosted on our side, and rendered on the seller's website real time, it enables us to track insightful product specific analytics 
which are better than plain old website traction analytics.
